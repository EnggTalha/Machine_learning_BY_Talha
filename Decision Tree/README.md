Iris Species Classification with Decision Tree
This project demonstrates how to classify different species of the Iris flower using a Decision Tree Classifier. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in machine learning that contains 150 samples of iris flowers with 4 features each: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to classify the species of the flower (Setosa, Versicolour, Virginica) based on these features.
